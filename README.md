Honest-calculator
A simple calculator but with some twists.
The input must be two numbers and the operation separated by spaces (ex: 5 + 5), if you type a wrong equation it will print a message and then ask the input again.
Features: you can add, subtract, multiply divide and store the result.
If your want to use the saved the number type 'M' as one number.
Hope you enjoy this simple and funny project that I've created.
Thanks for reading.
